Catlang is a systems programming language with a C-like syntax that compiles to native code. It is statically typed, and does not include automatic memory management.

It has been designed for both speed and kindness.

## Phases of Compilation

### Lexical Analysis

### Syntax Analysis

### Semantic Analysis

### Optimization

### Code Generation

## Memory Model

## Object Model

## Why Catlang?

My goal with Catlang is to produce a programming language well-suited for low-level programming (such as game development) which includes many of the features common in more modern programming languages. I hardly propose that Catlang is a universal fix, but it seems like an engaging venture for my specific uses (and personal opinions about what a "good programming language" looks like).

A few notes about specific opinions I hold: _kind_ type-safety is important. Compilers should be able to infer as much as possible. Functions should be first-class; purely functional languages are too rigid, especially when performance is critical, but enabling programmers to use _aspects_ of functional languages seems the best of both worlds.
